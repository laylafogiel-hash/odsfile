Introduction
------------

The odsfile is LuaLaTeX package and lua library for working with 
opendocument spreadsheet (ods) documents from Open/Libre Office Calc. 
It is possible to select cells from sheets and typeset them as LaTeX tables,
it is also possible to pass these data to LaTeX macros and make some plots,
for example.   

There is also simple interface to add data to existing spreadsheets. This 
functionality requires external zip utility.
 
This package uses LuaTeX's zip library and scripting to read these files. 
It also requires LuaXML library, which is available to download from
CTAN site.  

Because of lua scripting, it is not possible to use this package with pdfLaTeX 
or XeLaTeX. On the other side, odsfile.lua library can be used from PlainTeX, 
ConTeXt or pure lua scripts.

It may be distributed and/or modified under the conditions of the
